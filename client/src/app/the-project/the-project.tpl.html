    <p>
      A completely <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ubcio">open-source</a> website built by students for students, with only one idea in mind, that as a
      student collective,
      together, we can build great things. The website is divided into 3 sections:
      <em>Academics</em>, <em>Career</em>, and <em>Events</em>. Currently, the <em>Academics</em> section is for
      all students at UBC, while the <em>Career</em> and <em>Events</em> sections are only for computer science
      students. We are a small group of students working hard to make UBC a better place and hope to
      expand all parts of our website to all fields of study at UBC.
    </p>

    <p>
      In <em>Academics</em> you will find detailed professor reviews which will only be displayed if they are
      thoughtful and offer insight to both the students and the professors.
      Along with this you will find course prerequisites, descriptions, reviews, and tips which can help you watch out for
      common pitfalls. In case you do fall behind, tutors will be
      offered to help students - ubc.io will not be charging for this service, it is simply connecting students to
      tutors. Lastly, we provide an easy way to find your
      degree requirements, on top of general requirements, to make sure you take the right courses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over in <em>Career</em>, you will discover a free alternative to the CS Co-op program offered at UBC. We
      prepare you by showing you how to make your resume and structure your cover letters. Beyond
      the basics, we give you advice on how to prepare for technical interviews by
      walking you through practice problems as well as pointing you to great resources. Taking it one step
      further, we put job postings in one convenient location. As the ubc.io
      community expands we hope to partner with companies and have more postings. Lastly, we offer
      reviews of companies to show you where other interns enjoyed working! Although this is currently only for
      computer science students, we hope to expand our free Co-op program to all disciplines at UBC.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, in <em>Events</em>, we keep you posted on upcoming seminars, hackathons, and career fairs to make sure
      that you are aware of all your opportunities to grow as a programmer.
      Attending hackathons and/or seminars is a great way to discover what you love and refine your interests;
      attending career fairs is important to open new doors and expand your network. Similar to the <em>Career</em> section,
      we hope to expand this section to all disciplines at UBC and are working our hardest to figure out maintainable
      solutions to expand the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      All these cool free services will only be offered if everyone at UBC works together to contribute. We firmly believe
      that together we can build great things. Whether you are an english major, a business major, or a computer science
      major, there is room for everyone to contribute.
