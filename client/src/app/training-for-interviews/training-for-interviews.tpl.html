    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      After you go through our guide on creating resumes and cover letters you will be able to apply for jobs and
      sooner than later you will start getting invitations to interviews! This is awesome and it feels great to land
      your first interview at a
      company, especially one you really respect, but as great as landing an interview is it feels way better to
      actually
      get the job! How? Easy - you practice as much as you can, preferably for at least a month before
      you
      start getting interviews. If you are applying for a technical position at a well known company, you will
      likely go through an interview in which they will ask you technical questions. Depending on both the
      company and the position the questions range in difficulty and theme, but regardless of the specific question
      it will be incredibly helpful if you practice. How exactly do you practice? Easy - I have laid it all out for you.
      Firstly, make sure you understand the Problem Solving Design Pattern so that you can apply it when you are solving
      difficult questions. Next, quickly read my tips to make sure that you practice properly. Lastly, check out
      the resources listed and start practicing with whatever resource interests you most! Best of luck!

    <h2>Problem Solving Design Pattern (PSDP)</h2>

    <p>
      When asked to solve a question in an interview, a common mistake, a mistake I made myself for quite a long time,
      is to jump into solving the question immediately. Surprisingly, this is not a good approach! There are important
      steps that if followed correctly give can give you a large advantage. To make it as easy as possible, I have
      clearly
      stated each step below.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Clarify The Problem

        <p>
          You want to make sure that you clearly understand the problem statement. Having the perfect solution
          to the wrong problem isn't going to impress the interviewer. As well, questions in interviews are sometimes
          asked with details missing purposefully; they do this to see if you can identify and resolve the
          ambiguities. So ask questions and make sure you completely understand the problem!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Signature

        <p>
          If possible, write out the signatures of the methods you will be implementing, this often helps when
          you get confused half-way through a solution, to quickly look and remember what you are trying to
          do in the first place!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Test It

        <p>
          Think about possible inputs into your method and the results. When thinking of inputs, try and cover all the
          normal cases and edge cases. You'll be thankful when you are trying to solve the problem because it is very
          helpful to have tests with expected outputs while getting lost in a solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Solve It

        <p>
          Finally, you get to actually solve the problem. At this point you should clearly understand the problem, have
          the signature for the method you are about to implement, and understand the various edge cases and there
          expected
          results. When actually solving the problem, there is no need for code. You should be using pseudo-code and
          diagrams
          to make sure you have a good solution. Is your solution fast enough? Does it take too much space? These are
          good questions to ask yourself while you are solving the problem. If you come up with a "slow" solution but
          you
          cannot come up with a "fast" solution, do not panic - move on to the next stage and code your slow solution
          while talking to the interviewer about the potential weaknesses in the algorithm and the places it could
          improve.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Code It

        <p>
          Yay you actually get to write some code! At this point you have your solution in pseudo-code so implement
          your solution. If you forgot the names of standard methods it is not a big deal, do not get caught up
          in whether it is "string".size() or "string".length(), instead focusing on fully implementing your solution.
          When you forget the name of a standard method simply use a logical name in place (length or size are fine,
          your
          interviewer isn't going to care if you have memorized the standard library).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Check It

        <p>
          You thought you were done! Not quite! Look over your solution and try your tests in your head and
          see if you get back the expected results. It is much better to have a bug in your code and find it yourself
          than to have your interviewer find it for you. If you find any bugs simply point them out and try
          to fix them.

    <h2>Practice Tips</h2>

    <p>
      There are just a few important tips I wanted to leave with you before you start practicing for your interviews.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Do not use an IDE while you practice! The best ways to practice solving interview questions is in the exact same
        scenario that you will be doing the interview itself. If you will be interviewing with Google over the phone,
        then go ahead and practice writing code in a Google Doc. If you are going to be going to the company itself for
        the interview, practice on a whiteboard or on paper if you don't have access to a board. If you hate coding
        without an IDE because you love auto-complete, that's all the more reason to practice without one! You will
        not have auto-complete in the interview.
      </li>
      <li>
        Following the PSDP while practicing for interviews. If
        you don't follow the PSDP when you are practicing, you are not going to use it during your interview either.
        This includes the final step, going through your code and trying to debug it. It is important not to get lazy
        during your training and immediately plug your solutions into the computer before debugging them in your head.
        Always try and check if your solutions are correct mentally before plugging it into the computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Practice with a friend. It can be very stressful to work on a problem while someone is watching over your
        shoulder, but unfortunately this is exactly what the interview is going to be like. To prepare yourself, ask
        one of your friends who is also a CS student to interview you. If you have a friend who is also preparing for
        interviews, then rotate being the interviewer/interviewee.
      </li>

        <p>
          The author, Gayle Laakmann McDowell, is an incredibly talented woman who has devoted a lot of her time
          towards understanding technical interviews. She has worked at many top companies such as Microsoft, Apple,
          and Google; at Google she was one of the lead interviewers. Her book, "Cracking the Coding Interview", is
          perhaps the most well known book when it comes to practicing for technical interviews, and it's well known
          for a reason - it's a great book. Getting this book and working through the problems in any language is
          an excellent way to practice! It has about 200 problems so it will keep you busy for a long time!

          A small manageable set of problems that are designed to
          efficiently help you prepare for interviews. By the time you are done the ~45 problems, you are meant to be
          prepared for a wide range of technical interview questions. What's nice about this website
          is that there are hints for each question that guide you towards the correct answer, as well as
          clear detailed solutions to help you understand each step.

        Project Euler <a target="_blank" href="https://projecteuler.net/">Website</a>

        <p>
          An amazing way to practice for interviews and build up your critical thinking skills. It
          is an archive of Computer Science / Math problems of varying difficulty. Many of the questions in
          this archive are far more difficult than the questions you will encounter in an interview and so
          they can be an amazing way to practice. I do not recommend only practicing with Project Euler
          because it is important to practice easier interview-level questions, but I definitely think
          this is a great resource to strengthen the general skills you need in technical interviews!

        Repository</a>

        <p>
          This is a repository that I started when I was applying for Google to keep track of all my preparation.
          Slowly the repository expanded, and then I decided instead of just keeping track of my preparation I
          would put in the extra effort and turn it into a guide. First it goes over the implementation
          of numerous data structures and sorts to prepare you followed by a series of interview problems. All
          of the data structures, sorts, and problems are implemented in Java in my "answer key". I highly recommend
          to check out this repository and follow the guide in the repository, it'll tell you exactly what
          you need to do!
