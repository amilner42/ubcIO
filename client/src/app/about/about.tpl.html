                A website built by CS students for CS students, with only one idea in mind, that as a student collective, together, we can do better. The website is divided into 3 sections:
                <em>Academics</em>, <em>Career</em>, and <em>Community</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <em>Academics</em> you will find detailed professor reviews which will only be displayed if they are thoughtful and offer insight to both the students and the professors.
                Along with this you will find course prerequisites, descriptions, and tips which can help you watch out for common pitfalls. In case you do fall behind, tutors will be
                offered to help students - ubcIO will not be charging for this service, it is simply connecting students to tutors. Lastly, we provide an easy way to find your
                degree requirements, on top of general requirements, to make sure you take the right courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over in <em>Career</em>, you will discover a free alternative to the CS Co-op program offered at UBC. We show you how to make your resume (with multiple examples approved by
                the Co-op office) and structure your cover letters to prepare you for the entire process. Beyond the basics, we give you advice on how to prepare for technical interviews by
                walking you through practice problems as well as pointing you to great resources. Taking it one step further, we put job postings in one convenient location. As the ubcIO
                community expands we hope to partner with more companies and have more postings. Lastly, we offer descriptions of companies to show you what cool work is around, as well as
                reviews to show you where other interns enjoyed working!
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, in <em>community</em>, we keep you posted on upcoming seminars and hackathons to make sure that you are aware of all your oppurtunities to grow as a programmer.
                Attending either hackathons or seminars is a great way to discover what you love and refine your interests. As well, to encourage you to join the community and start collaborating
                on cool projects together, we offer a service to link you to other students who want to start developing!
            </p>
            <p>
                All these cool free services will only be offered if everyone in the CS community works together to contributre. We firmly belive that together we can do better. If their is
                a professor who you want to commend or give constructive critism, please email us at ubcio.team@gmail.com. If you are a tutor we would be greatful if you posted your services
                here, and if you thought of a cool new project and want to start a team please send us an email as well! If you have any thoughts at all that you would like to share with us,
                the founders of ubcIO, please email us at
                the same email: ubcio.team@gmail.com and we will respond promptly.
