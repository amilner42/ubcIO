      <p>
        A website built by CS students for CS students, with only one idea in mind, that as a student collective,
        together, we can do better. The website is divided into 3 sections:
        <em>Academics</em>, <em>Career</em>, and <em>Events</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In <em>Academics</em> you will find detailed professor reviews which will only be displayed if they are
        thoughtful and offer insight to both the students and the professors.
        Along with this you will find course prerequisites, descriptions, and tips which can help you watch out for
        common pitfalls. In case you do fall behind, tutors will be
        offered to help students - ubc.io will not be charging for this service, it is simply connecting students to
        tutors. Lastly, we provide an easy way to find your
        degree requirements, on top of general requirements, to make sure you take the right courses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over in <em>Career</em>, you will discover a free alternative to the CS Co-op program offered at UBC. We
        prepare you by showing you how to make your resume and structure your cover letters. Beyond
        the basics, we give you advice on how to prepare for technical interviews by
        walking you through practice problems as well as pointing you to great resources. Taking it one step
        further, we put job postings in one convenient location. As the ubc.io
        community expands we hope to partner with companies and have more postings. Lastly, we offer
        reviews of companies to show you where other interns enjoyed working!
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, in <em>Events</em>, we keep you posted on upcoming seminars, hackathons, and career fairs to make sure
        that you are aware of all your opportunities to grow as a programmer.
        Attending hackathons and/or seminars is a great way to discover what you love and refine your interests;
        attending career fairs is important to open new doors and expand your network.
      </p>

      <p>
        All these cool free services will only be offered if everyone in the CS community works together to
        contribute. We firmly believe that together we can do better. If their is
        a professor who you want to commend or give constructive criticism, please email us.
        If you are a tutor and would like to offer your services, please email us! If
        you have any thoughts at all that you would like to share with us, the ubc.io team, please email us at:
        ubcio.team@gmail.com and we will respond promptly.
