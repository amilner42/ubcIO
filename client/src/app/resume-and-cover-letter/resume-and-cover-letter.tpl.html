    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <h5>Purpose</h5>

    <p>
      Before writing your resume it's best to understand how it will be used. In most cases, an employer will
      get at minimum tens of applications, from which they must pick only a handful of applicants that they will
      interview. No one enjoys going through hundreds of resumes carefully reading each detail, which is why
      no one does! The amount of time someone is going to spend reading your resume is likely 15 - 60
      seconds - this should shape the way you write your resume! Your resume should summarize your skills
      and experiences while still being an easy read.

    <h5>Key Tips</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Do NOT fill your resume with fluff to try and fill up as much space as possible. In general, the shorter a
        resume the better. A resume should be one or two pages, depending on whether you can fit everything on one
        page.

          This very short guide quickly and effectively explains the most important things about making a resume!
          The are two things I would like to mention briefly about this resource.
          Firstly, he recommends making your resume 1 page, this is good advice but as mentioned in the Key Points
          two pages is fine if necessary. Secondly, he recommends tailoring your resume for each application, while
          this is good advice it is extremely time consuming - personalizing each cover letter while leaving
          your resume constant is completely acceptable.

    <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
    <h5>Purpose</h5>

    <p>
      Firstly, for those who don't know, a cover letter is a short document sent with your resume. Employers
      will normally read this before taking a look at your resume (but not always). So the obvious question that follows:
      we already have resumes so what the heck is the point of cover letters?! A cover letter is a way of introducing
      yourself to the employer and showing them why you want to a be a part of their team. While your resume is
      all about you, your cover letters should be all about the them. It should explain why you are a good fit
      for the team by matching your skills to their needs.
    </p>
    <h5>Key Tips</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the first couple sentences of your cover letter gripping to try and catch the eyes of a
        tired and possibly bored hiring manager. When writing your cover letter, imagine that it will
        be in a pile of 100+ cover letters - you need to write something so interesting in the beginning
        that it actually convinces the hiring manager to read the rest of your cover letter and look at
        your resume.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep it short and sweet. At most a cover letter should be about half a page of writing. The longer
        you make your cover letter the less likely it is that it will be read. Some companies/recruiters
        ask for cover letters as short as 5 sentences! If they do not ask for a specific length, sticking to a max
        of half a page is a safe bet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid generic cover letters.
        Show your interest in the company and explain why you will be a good fit for that particular company.
        To do this, it is helpful to do some background research on the company to get a better idea of
        where your skills match up with their needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use passionate language, show that you really care about working with that specific company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show them your personality as best as you can through your writing. Many companies use the cover
        letter as a way to get a basic idea of who you are as a human being.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do NOT copy paste chunks of your resume over to your cover letter. You can mention things that are listed in your
        resume but you do not need to go over them in the same level of detail...that's the point of a resume. Remember
        you are sending these two documents in together so if they read something interesting in your cover
        letter they can go take a look at your resume for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do NOT include important information in your cover letter that is not included in your resume. Everything important
        should be on your resume. This is important because many employers nowadays do not even read the cover letter so
        you want to include everything in the resume.

          The cover letter listed on the second page of the PDF is a great example of a computer science cover letter. Take a look!
          Ignore all the other pages, they focus on topics that are not important to us.
