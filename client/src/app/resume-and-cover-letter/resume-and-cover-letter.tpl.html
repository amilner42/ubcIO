    <h2>Resume</h2>
    <h5>Purpose</h5>

    <p>
      Before writing your resume it's best to understand how it will be used. In most cases, an employer will
      get at minimum tens of applications, from which they must pick only a handful of applicants that they will
      interview. No one enjoys going through hundreds of resumes carefully reading each detail, which is why
      no one does! The amount of time someone is going to spend reading your resume is likely 15 - 60
      seconds - this should shape the way you write your resume! Your resume should summarize your skills
      and experiences while still being an easy read.
    </p>

    <h5>Key Tips</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Do NOT fill your resume with fluff to try and fill up as much space as possible. The shorter your
        resume the better - try to stick to one page. You may think that the hiring manager is going
        to be impressed with your 2-3 page resume but in reality they will only spend about
        30 seconds skimming over it.
      </li>
      <li>
        When including projects you have done on your resume (which is essential) don't forget to include the URL.
        If you have personal projects that are not online, spend a little bit of time familiarizing yourself with
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github</a> so you can get those projects online! If possible,
        pick 3-5 of your projects and list them on your resume. They can be personal projects or school related.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a resume template with columns - it makes you're resume look neat also helps fit more in one page.
      </li>
      <li>
        As mentioned below in the resources, do NOT include "objectives" in your resume. Your objective is to get a job
        with your resume and the recruiters are well aware of that. It wastes space on your resume that you could
        use for something more crucial.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep your bullets short (1 to 2 lines each). Start the sentences with actions verbs such as: "created,"
        "implemented," "optimized," "designed" or "built." Avoid verbs like "contributed to" or "helped with".

          He recommends tailoring your resume for each application, while
          this is good advice it is extremely time consuming - personalizing each cover letter while leaving
          your resume constant is completely acceptable.

    <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
    <h5>Purpose</h5>

    <p>
      Firstly, for those who don't know, a cover letter is a short document sent with your resume. Employers
      will normally read this before taking a look at your resume (but not always). So the obvious question that
      follows:
      we already have resumes so what the heck is the point of cover letters?! A cover letter is a way of introducing
      yourself to the employer and showing them why you want to a be a part of their team. While your resume is
      all about you, your cover letters should be all about the them. It should explain why you are a good fit
      for the team by matching your skills to their needs.
    </p>
    <h5>Key Tips</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the first couple sentences of your cover letter gripping to try and catch the eyes of a
        tired and possibly bored hiring manager. When writing your cover letter, imagine that it will
        be in a pile of 100+ cover letters - you need to write something so interesting in the beginning
        that it actually convinces the hiring manager to read the rest of your cover letter and look at
        your resume.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep it short and sweet. The longer
        you make your cover letter the less likely it is that it will be read. Some companies/recruiters
        ask for cover letters as short as 5 sentences! If they do not ask for a specific length, sticking to around
        half a page is a safe bet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid generic cover letters.
        Show your interest in the company and explain why you will be a good fit for that particular company.
        To do this, it is helpful to do some background research on the company to get a better idea of
        where your skills match up with their needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use passionate language, show that you really care about working with that specific company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show them your personality as best as you can through your writing. Many companies use the cover
        letter as a way to get a basic idea of who you are as a human being.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do NOT copy paste chunks of your resume over to your cover letter. You can mention things that are listed in
        your
        resume but you do not need to go over them in the same level of detail...that's the point of a resume. Remember
        you are sending these two documents in together so if they read something interesting in your cover
        letter they can go take a look at your resume for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do NOT include important information in your cover letter that is not included in your resume. Everything
        important
        should be on your resume - this is critical because many employers do not even read the cover letter.
