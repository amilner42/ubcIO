    At UBC, like all Universities, we have a range of professors, some mediocore (being polite here) 
    and some exceptional. Regardless, they all could improve because teaching is fucking hard (not being polite here). Here 
    you will find highly detailed reviews on professors, not only giving students an idea of where 
    these professors stand on the mediocore-exceptional spectrum but also giving professors insight
    on where they could improve along with what they did well. If you have a 
    professor who really made an impact on your education then write an awesome review for them and make their 
    day - after all we need to keep our exceptional professors motivated! If you had a "mediocore" professor 
    then write a review explaining what the professor did that made him/her "mediocore", most of these 
    professors are actively looking for ways to improve.
    
    To write a review, email us at ubcio.team@gmail.com with the name of the professor, the course you 
    took, and the review. We look forward to hearing about your experiences and are thankful to all 
    the contributers in the ubc.io community!
